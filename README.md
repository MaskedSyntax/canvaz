## Overview

**Canvaz** is a lightweight, GTK-based wallpaper manager built with Python for Linux desktops.  
Inspired by tools like Nitrogen but architected from scratch, Canvaz goes further:

- Set wallpapers effortlessly
- Fetch stunning images from online sources
- Rotate wallpapers automatically (daily or on demand)
- Manage your local wallpaper library with ease

Itâ€™s **not a fork** â€” this is a fresh and evolving project focused on giving users control and customization without clutter.

## Features

- **Fast local wallpaper setting** for X11 and (in the future) Wayland
- **Time-based wallpaper rotation** (e.g., change every day at midnight)
- **Online wallpaper fetching** from APIs like Unsplash or Reddit
- **Simple, native GTK UI** with responsive layout
- **Linux-only by design**, avoiding cross-platform complexity
- **Written in Python**, modular and easy to hack on
